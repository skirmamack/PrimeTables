# PrimeTables
Coding exercise - Prime tables

The program is a C# .NET Console application. Build it and run the exe.
Packed compiled exe file is also included in PrimeTables\bin folder.

As requested, program displays only first 10 prime numbers table. However, this limitation is done only when displaying it. The code still generates a full table. This has been done in order not to limit prime numbers and prime table generator. If specified to do so, would be easy to limit generators as well, not just displaying the table.

What I am pleased with is that this exercise, I believe, covers quite a lot (TDD, clean code writing, structure, using GitHub and etc.). Though seems quite simple at the same time. And quite unique to be honest.

What I wouldn’t definitely do is would do that many commits in real life. This has been done only because you requested to do so.

Complexity of the coded prime numbers’ generator is a kind exponential. That’s is because adding a new prime number requires more and more checking operations. That’s definitely would be satisfying when dealing with big volumes of prime numbers. In real life, if these operations with big volumes would be needed frequently, would think of caching, storing as pre-calculated, hashing. Also would search for associated algorithms.

Hope you will not judge if seems over engineered. It's always difficult to find the balance when trying to code well.
